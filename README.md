## 1. Overview

## [2. Output An Image](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html#outputanimage)

### notes

-   seemingly, you can have an arbitrary (fixed) number of pixels per line in .ppm, there's only 1 pixel per row in our output.

### todo

-   i don't grok the scaling (`255.999`) yet.   


## 3. [The vec3 class](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html#thevec3class)

### notes

-   it's not a good idea to be eagerly evaluated properties into classes that may be computationally expensive
